I have been watching Anime for over 20 years at this point of my life. I always found it interesting that I enjoyed watching these animated shows that required subtitles in my situation as an American born English speaker. Then I realized it isn’t just me.

Astro Boy was the first Anime that went mainstream in North America, this was in the 1960s.
Anime is a big staple even outside of Japan with 2018’s global sales revenues being around. **4.8 Billion** (with a B) USD. North America holds 42 percent of the Anime based contracts made outside of Japan. 

**What does this mean?** It means that Anime isn’t just a big deal in Japan but also in North America.

Taking my love for Anime combined with its importance to North America I decided to use computer vision to classify Anime characters.

**Why is this necessary?** 

1.	This could help future studies of what shows are similar in character design and if there is a correlation with character style and popularity.
2.	This can enhance the recommendation process by identifying character and recommending based on the image.

# Data

I used beautiful soup to scrape over 5,000 images from google images. This consist of characters from the following Animes.

**One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Death Note, Black Clover, Fairy Tail, Attack On Titan, Cowboy Bebop, Full Metal Alchemist**
